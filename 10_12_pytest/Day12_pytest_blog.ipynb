    "Day 10 to 12 of #100daysofpython- Pytest\n",
    "Days 10 to 12 are focused on pytest. I took the time to read Brian Okken's book Python Testing with pytest. It was a great introduction to pytest and I recommend it for anyone looking to start. Here are some highlights of pytest from the past 3 days -\n",
    "Pytest Naming Conventions\n",
    "As long as you follow proper naming conventions, pytest will be able to find your tests within the current working directory or sub-directories.\n",
    "Test files should be named test_<name>.py or <name>_test.py\n",
    "Test methods and functions should be named test_<name>\n",
    "Test classes should follow the camel case convention of Test<Name>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a Pytest Test Case\n",
    "Defining a test function is pretty straight forward. Pytest uses assert statements for validation much like the standard unittest library.\n",
    "def test_get_single_good_item(test_client):\n",
    "     response = test_client.get(GOOD_ITEM_URL)\n",
    "     data = json.loads(response.get_data())\n",
    "     assert response.status_code == 200\n",
    "     assert len(data['items']) == 1\n",
    "     assert data['items'][0]['id'] == 3\n",
    "Executing a Pytest Test Case\n",
    "Executing all test files found in the directory named tests\n",
    ">> pytest ./tests/\n",
    "Execute all test cases in the file named test_one.py\n",
    ">> pytest test_one.py\n",
    "Execute all tests found in the class named TestClass within test_one.py.\n",
    ">> pytest test_one.py::TestClass\n",
    "Execute the test case named test_add_item in a file named test_one.py.\n",
    ">> pytest test_one.py::test_add_item\n",
    "Execute all test cases in the file name test_one.py, in verbose mode\n",
    ">> pytest -v test_one.py\n",
    "Testing Exceptions\n",
    "It's important that you test error handling along with the rest of your code. Pytest allows you to catch and validate errors using pytest.rasies\n",
    "def number_check(number):\n",
    "     if number > 10:\n",
    "          raise ValueError()\n",
    " \n",
    "def test_throw_error():\n",
    "     with pytest.raises(ValueError):\n",
    "          number_check(22) \n",
    "Pytest will run the above test case and expect to receive a ValueError.\n",
    "If no exception is raised, the test will fail.\n",
    "If the test raises a different exception than ValueError, the test will fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validating stdout/stderr output\n",
    "Capsys allows you to capture information sent to stdout & stderr and validate as required.\n",
    "def happy_friday(name):\n",
    "     print('Happy Friday {}!'.format(name))\n",
    "def test_happy_friday(capsys):\n",
    "     happy_friday('Roy')\n",
    "     out, err = capsys.readouterr()\n",
    " \n",
    "     assert out == 'Happy Friday Roy!'\n",
    "     assert err == ''\n",
    "Fixtures\n",
    "Fixtures allow you to place dependencies on test cases, controlling when a dependent function is run and the values that are returned.\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "@pytest.fixture(scope='session')\n",
    "def test_client():\n",
    "     \"\"\"\n",
    "     Create a flask test client, returning the client to each \n",
    "     function as required\n",
    "     \"\"\"\n",
    "     testing_client = app.app.test_client()\n",
    "     testing_client.testing = True\n",
    "     yield testing_client\n",
    "\n",
    "@pytest.fixture(scope='function')\n",
    "def item():\n",
    "     \"\"\"\n",
    "     returns a valid item in the form of a dictionary\n",
    "     \"\"\"\n",
    "     return {'name':'box','value':340}\n",
    " \n",
    "def test_create_valid_item(test_client, item):\n",
    "     \"\"\"\n",
    "     GIVEN a flask application\n",
    "     WHEN a user requests to create a new item\n",
    "     THEN check that the item is successfully added to the db\n",
    "     \"\"\"\n",
    "     response = test_client.post(BASE_URL,\n",
    "                                 data=json.dumps(item),\n",
    "                                 content_type='application/json')\n",
    "     data = json.loads(response.get_data())\n",
    "     assert response.status_code == 201\n",
    "     assert data['item']['name'] == item['name']\n",
    "     assert data['item']['value'] == item['value']\n",
    "     assert data['item']['id'] > 0\n",
    "The test case test_create_valid_item contains two parameters known as fixtures. As pytest executes the test case, it searches for the fixtures test_client & item, executing these prior to running the actual test case.\n",
    "Test_client creates a flask application and item creates a test item to be added to the application. These dependencies can be reused across multiple test cases, reducing the amount of code.\n",
    "As you can see above, fixtures allow you to define scope, allowing you to control how often the fixture is run. Available scopes include:\n",
    "function (run once per test)\n",
    "class (run once per class of tests)\n",
    "module (run once per module)\n",
    "session (run once per session)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below, test_client will only be executed once and shared between all functions within the session. Whereas item will be run each time it is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The above just scratches the surface of what you can do in pytest. Other notable items to look into:\n",
    "parametrize arguments to allow multiple input validation on a single run\n",
    "Incorporate pytest-cov to see your test coverage and identify missing coverage down to the line number.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's been great to take a deep dive on this library and will be useful in future coding!\n",
    "Cheers\n",
